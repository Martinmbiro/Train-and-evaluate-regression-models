This data is then split into two subsets:  \n","+ A **training** dataset to which we'll apply an algorithm that determines a function encapsulating the relationship between the feature values and the known label values.\n","+ A **validation** or *test* dataset that we can use to evaluate the model by using it to generate predictions for the label and comparing them to the actual known label values.\n","\n","> Regression is an example of supervised machine learning since it makes use of historic data with known label values to train a model. Supervised Machine Learning algorithims can be divided into two:  \n","+ **Regression algorithms:** Algorithms that predict a y value that is a numeric value, such as the price of a house or the number of sales transactions.  \n","+ **Classification algorithms:** Algorithms that predict to which category, or class, an observation belongs. The y value in a classification model is a vector of probability values between 0 and 1, one for each class, indicating the probability of the observation belonging to each class."],"metadata":{"id":"nAr1qIyYFNQR"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **Model Loss**\n","---\n","```\n","   predicted value - observed value = error / residual\n","```\n","> We can summarize the residuals for all of the validation data predictions to calculate the overall **loss** in the model as a measure of its predictive performance.\n","\n","> Ways to calcuate the loss:\n","+ **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** - Mean of the summation of the squared residuals\n","+ **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** - Square root of MSE - if a model's RMSE is 3, it can interpret loosely as meaning that on average, incorrect predictions are wrong by around 3\n","+ **R Squared** (sometimes known as coefficient of determination) - correlation between x and y squared. This produces a value between 0 and 1 that measures the amount of variance that can be explained by the model.
