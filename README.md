Hello again üëã
+ This repository involves training a Machine Learning Regression Model to predict the number of bicycle rentals, given prevailing weather conditions for a particular day  
+ It is my implementation of a course I've taken on creating and evaluating Machine Learning Regression Models  
+ I have included notes and comments to express my understanding. Links to official documentation are also attached.
+ I've implemented novel concepts (that I've learned on my own) too, such as [`optuna`](https://optuna.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) for hyperparameter search, `early_stopping` and `eval_set` to control overfitting and [`cross_val_score`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.cross_val_score.html) during training rounds to identify the best model.
+ And what do you know, my final model (included in the `model` folder), outperformed the model trained in the course - by far!
